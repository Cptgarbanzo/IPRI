		The Primary adversary of the IPRI is collectively known as the otherworld.  While our reality has developed through science and technology, the Otherworld has developed through the use of magic.  Within that world there is are societies much like ours, driven with their own independant goals.  However, and the ability of the denizens of Otherworld to travel to ours becomes more prevalent, the Otherworlders have become more interested in ours.  The ability we consider magic has become more commonplace and the threat of the otherworld has become significantly greater.
