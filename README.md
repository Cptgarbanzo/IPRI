informational website for home grown tabletop RPG
still working on system mechanics to fill into the pages. Need to build a filable character generation page,  want to build a location on the site where a new player can log in, build their own agent profile and have it on the website.  want to build a submission section for crypto's adventures and other such things.  My wants are vast and full of themselves.
